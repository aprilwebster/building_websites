# Part I: Getting Started with SEO

## Introduction to SEO

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of improving the ranking of a website on search engines like Google and Bing. This part covers the foundational concepts you'll need to understand to start optimizing your site.

## Understanding How Search Engines Work

Search engines crawl the web, indexing content to build a searchable database. When a user types a query, the search engine provides results based on relevance, content quality, and other factors.

### Actionable Steps:

1. **Understand Search Engine Crawling**:
   - **Crawlers**: Automated bots like Googlebot scan your site, following links and indexing content.
   - **Robots.txt**: Use this file to control what parts of your site crawlers can access.
   - **Sitemaps**: Submit an XML sitemap to help search engines find and index your pages.

2. **Ensure Your Site Is Indexed**:
   - **Google Search Console**: Sign up and submit your site to check its indexing status.
   - **Bing Webmaster Tools**: Do the same for Bing to cover another major search engine.

## Quick Tips for a Search Engine-Friendly Site

### Actionable Steps:

1. **Check Your Site's Indexing Status**:
   - Use `site:yourdomain.com` in Google to see what pages are indexed.

2. **Fix Common Errors**:
   - **Blocked Pages**: Check your `robots.txt` file to ensure it’s not blocking important pages.
